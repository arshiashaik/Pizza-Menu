This project is a simple website built using React that displays six different pizzas. It demonstrates fundamental concepts in React such as components, JSX, and props. It does not have any backend functionality and is purely a front-end showcase.



## 💻 Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML 
- CSS




## 💡Learnings

- JSX (JavaScript XML): It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows for the creation of React elements in a more familiar HTML-like syntax. JSX is heavily used throughout this project to define the structure of components and their contents.
- Props (short for properties): They are a way of passing data from parent to child components in React.
- Components: The project is structured using React components. They let us split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
